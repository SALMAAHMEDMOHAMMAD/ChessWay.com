                <h2>What is sports management?</h2>
                <p>Sport management refers to the management of various business functions in sports and recreation organizations. Depending on their specific job title, sport management professionals might plan, direct, organize or budget within a sports-related organization.</p>
                <p>Some love sports. Some love taking chances and challenges. These traits, together, make a winning combination for a career in sports management, which includes any and every business aspect of sports and recreation.</p>
                <h2>What is the meaning of chess?</h2>
                <p>Chess is a board game that has been played for centuries. It is a good idea to involve your child in a game of chess with the help of experienced tutors in chess. It is a strategic game that can be played by two people, and it often involves strategy and planning.
The game of chess occupies a special position among all cultural activities due to its complexity and dynamics at the interface of culture, science, sport, and games. It has been played worldwide for more than a millennium and has always generated an enormous echo in society, art, and culture that goes far beyond any other game.</p>
                <p>Let's start learning the benefits of chess!!</p>
                <h2>Benefits of playing chess,and why we should play chess!</h2>
                <p>The scientific study included 10,318 participants whose median age was 73.8 years. It was
conducted over 10 years (from 2010 to 2020), and more than half of the study participants
were women. The analysis of study results was not completed until March 2023.The study found that playing chess reduces the risk of dementia lower than activities
considered beneficial by popular culture such as creative artistic activities (craftwork and
painting) and passive mental activities (reading books). So put down that book unless it is a
book related to chess.The researchers particularly noted that chess playing typically involve proactive engagement, critical thinking, logical reasoning, and social
interaction.This sport provides new skills for people in all ages spescially kids such as:memorization, imagination,responsibility,calm under pressure,problem solving,and etc...</p>
                 <p>Higher IQ, Do smart people play chess, or does chess make people smart? A study shows that chess increases IQ: 4,000 students from Venezuela significantly increased their IQ after just four months of playing chess. So grab a chessboard and boost your IQ.</p>

                 <p>While chess is a serious game, it also has many benefits to the environment. Chess is a great way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. By reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it makes our planet a better place for all of us. To help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, chess games have been introduced in schools across the United States in conjunction with climate change awareness.</p>


                <h2>Playing chess reduces the risk of Dementia by 9 percent. </h2>
                <p>Playing chess and engaging in other forms of active mental activities clearly reduces the
risk of dementia, according to the study. In fact, they result in a nine-percent lower risk of
dementia. In addition, using a computer and engaging in similar forms of adult literacy
activities provide an even greater reduction: 11 percent. So play chess online!</p>

                 <p>1) Chess Develops Logic, Critical Thinking, and Creativity
                       Chess exercises both sides of the brain.
              The game of chess requires a lot of “if this, then-that” scenarios, requiring players to imagine all the potential moves, alternatives and outcomes of each possibility.
              One study, conducted by Robert Ferguson, executive director of the American Chess School in Pennsylvania found that kids who had been playing chess versus computer games scored 13 percentage points higher in critical thinking and 35 percentage points higher in creative thinking.</p>
                 <hr>
                 <p>2) Chess Increases Concentration & Memory
Studies have shown that children who play chess regularly significantly improve their visual memory and concentration. A fantastic aspect of chess is that the game rewards you for concentration and penalizes you for losing it. Lose focus and you lose a piece, or worse, the game! Maintain focus and you're likely to win! This aspect of the game of chess gives a child's brain a fun incentive to stay focused while playing!</p>
